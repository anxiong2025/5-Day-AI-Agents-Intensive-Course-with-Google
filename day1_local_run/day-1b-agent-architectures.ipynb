    "\n",
    "Just like a team of people, you can create specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex problems. This is called a **multi-agent system**, and it's one of the most powerful concepts in AI agent development.\n",

      "*   **Elaborate on the map's mystery:** The description of the map is evocative, but consider adding a small detail or two that hints at its origin or purpose. For example, are the celestial symbols recognizable constellations, or are they entirely alien? Does the kelp-like material feel alive or ancient in a specific way? These small additions can deepen the sense of wonder.\n",
      "*   **Consider the immediate next step:** The story ends with Elias feeling a new purpose. What is his very next action? Does he immediately try to decipher the map, does he start preparing for a journey, or does he simply stare at it, lost in thought? Showing this immediate reaction can provide a stronger hook for the continuation of the story.\n",
      "RefinerAgent > Elias traced the salt-crusted lines on the worn oak table, the familiar grain a testament to fifty years of solitude. The rhythmic sweep of his lighthouse beam had been his sole companion, a predictable pulse against the vast indifference of the sea. But tonight, the brine-scented air carried a different kind of current, a thrum of the unknown. A storm, fiercer than any he’d weathered, had churned the seabed, depositing a barnacle-encrusted chest at the base of his tower. Inside, nestled amongst sodden fishing nets, lay a rolled parchment.\n",

It depicted islands that existed only in myth, scattered across an ocean of sapphire ink. A single, pulsing star, brighter than any known constellation, marked a location far beyond the familiar shipping lanes. Elias, whose life had been dedicated to guiding others safely, felt a yearning he hadn't known he possessed – a deep ache for the uncharted, for an adventure that had eluded him for decades. This map, pulsing with forgotten magic, felt like an answer to a question he’d never dared to ask. He carefully re-rolled the kelp-map, his heart pounding with a mixture of trepidation and exhilarating purpose. His next step, he knew, was to try and understand the language of the stars etched before him, to find a way to decipher its secrets before the sea reclaimed its own.\n",
